# Braille Alphabet Converter

## Description

This project was developed as part of a Technical University of Vienna assignment. The goal was to implement a program that converts text to and from Braille representation.

The **project structure** — including packages, interfaces, the main application class, and method headers — was provided as part of the assignment.  
The **implementation of all methods was developed entirely by me**.

## Features

- Convert normal text into Braille
- Convert Braille back to readable text
- Only letters are supported. If signs or numbers are added, they will be returned as blank spaces — both in the Braille output and in the decoded text.
